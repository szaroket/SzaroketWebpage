## --PROJECT IN PROGRESS--

## **About the project**

This is a static website project that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Bootstrap). The goal is to create a website presenting a gallery of drawings and photos of the artist. The site should allow to leave comments, evaluate drawings / photos, and also contain information about the artist, art supplies and have a contact form. 

## **Next steps**

After doing a static page I will be doing a dynamic website (probably using Node.js or Express.js - to think about it). My last goal is to build more less the same app in Angular 4 to learn and practice.

## **The appearance of the current site**

First demo can be found [here] (https://szaroket.github.io/SzaroketWebpage/)
